1. Project Overview
UTXOBridge is a decentralized cross-chain protocol that allows BTC assets to flow efficiently and securely between the exSat ecosystem and the BTC main chain.
It leverages Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC), Taproot, and UTXO abstraction technologies to build a trustless cross-chain gateway, enabling BTC assets to be used directly within the exSat ecosystem and facilitating low-cost, second-level transactions.
2. Core Features
ðŸ”¹ UTXO Model Abstraction:
Compatible with BTC UTXO transaction model and exSat account model, allowing BTC assets to seamlessly integrate with exSat applications.
ðŸ”¹ Trustless Cross-Chain Bridge:
Achieves cross-chain transfers without third-party custody via HTLC + Taproot.
Users retain control of their keys, with no centralized gateway, ensuring security.
ðŸ”¹ Lightning Network Integration:
Combines Lightning Network (LN) and exSat API to allow instant BTC payments within the exSat ecosystem.
Low fees, supports micropayments and high-frequency transactions.
ðŸ”¹ Smart UTXO Selection:
Automated UTXO selection and management to reduce cross-chain transaction costs.
Combines CoinJoin for enhanced privacy protection.
ðŸ”¹ Multi-Wallet Support:
Integrates Stacks, Lightning, and Taproot-compatible wallets, supporting mobile SDKs and DApp APIs.
Adapts to exSat ecosystemâ€™s native wallet.
